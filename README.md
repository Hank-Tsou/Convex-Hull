# Convex Hull
```
This project is trying to implement convex hull by using Graham's Scan Algorithm.
```

### Convex Hull
Given a group of points, the set of convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contain all the points. The example and the result of the program show as below:
```
File name: convex_hull_implementation.py
Command line: python convex_hull_implementation.py 
```
![](README_IMG/convex_hull.png)
```
NOTE: 
  - the green dots are random points and the blue line is the "convex hull" of the points
  - the corner with no green dot is the start points, because for image the origin of coordinates is on the top-left
```
